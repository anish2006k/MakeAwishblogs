        Why do we sleep only at night? Why don't we sleep at day??

          We see people working at day and taking rest at night. Even most of us work at day and sleep at night. There are around only 6.5% of
          the world's population that work all the night and sleep out all the day?? Have we ever asked ourselves that why do we sleep at night
          and work in the day time??? Actually there are many reasons behind this, following are the major ones:
          <div class="points">
            - Our brain usually releases melatonin at night time, melatonin is a hormone which makes us sleepy, and this hormone is reactive to
            darkness, therefore when it becomes dark our brain, starts releasing melatonin.
          </div>
          <div class="points">
            - Next point, is that our brain doesn't much melatonin in the day time therefore, most of us doesn't feel much sleepy during day time.
          </div>
          <div class="points">
            - Our brain has a system called the circadian biological clock which tells us that it's the time of sleep or it's the time to wake up, 
            and as we work very much at day, the circadian biological clock tells us that it's time to sleep and then we go to bed. It is also
            responsible for waking up us at day time. We have observed that when we sleep late at night, we wake also late in the morning, this is
            because the circadian biological clock always wake us up after around 6-8 hours of sleep.
          </div>
          <div class="points">
            - Our brain has another mechanism called SCN which responds to the ligth received by our eyes. Whenever it becomes night, SCN signals
            our circadian biological clock that it is the time to sleep, and when our eye receives the first daylight,  it signals the circadian
            biological clock that it is the time to wake us up. SCN can also operate the melatonin levels.
          </div>
          <div class="points">
            - Other than our body needs, there also many health issues like, sunlight gives us positivity and vitamin-D, and lack of sleep during
            night time can lead to health issues like anxiety, stress, headaches etc....
